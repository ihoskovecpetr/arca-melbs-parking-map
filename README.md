# Melbourne parking app - Web

### `Complexities`

Figure out which API dataset to use.\
Figure out how 'data.melbourne' API works.\
React wrappers seem to not work well, I had to use native Google maps library.\
Did not implement sorting by payment type.\

### `Thought processes`

Based on CRA project.\
Filtering on server vs in browser.\
I have spend much more than 3 hours, maybe over 5.. (Due to testing different libraries for displaying map).\

### `How to run the project?`

1. npm i\
2. update '.env' file.\
3. npm start
