# Melbourne parking app - Web

### `Complexities`

Figure out which API dataset to use
Figure out how data.melbourne works
React wrappers seem to not work well, I had to use native Google maps library
Did not implement sorting by payment type

### `Thought processes`

Filtering on server vs in browser.
I have spend much more than 3 hours, maybe over 5.. (Due to testing different libraries for displaying map)
